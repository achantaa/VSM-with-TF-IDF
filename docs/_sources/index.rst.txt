Domain Specific Information Retrieval
=====================================
This project aims to build a Domain Specific Search Engine that searches a given corpus. The courpus used is an XML file dump from NASA that contains a list of all the research papers that were published in the 1950s-2000s on Astronomy and related topics.
There are four categories to search from - Title, Author, Description, and Year of Publication. For instructions on how to run the program, see 'Readme.txt'.



* This documentation contains the list of all functions and modules used in this program.
* There are 4 modules - calc, tfidf, preprocessor and main. Click on 'Module Index' to get a list of all 4, and choose the one which you want to see.
* In each module, click on the '[source]' button to see the source code for the corresponding function.
